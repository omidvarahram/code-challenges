/**
 * An integer M and a non-empty array A consisting of N non-negative integers are given. All integers in array A are less than or equal to M.

A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N, is called a slice of array A. The slice consists of the elements A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[Q]. A distinct slice is a slice consisting of only unique numbers. That is, no individual number occurs more than once in the slice.

For example, consider integer M = 6 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 2
There are exactly nine distinct slices: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 4).

The goal is to calculate the number of distinct slices.

Write a function:

function solution(M: number, A: number[]): number;

that, given an integer M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct slices.

If the number of distinct slices is greater than 1,000,000,000, the function should return 1,000,000,000.

For example, given integer M = 6 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 2
the function should return 9, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
M is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..M].
 */

function solution(M: number, A: number[]): number {
    const seen = new Array(M + 1).fill(-1);
    let head = 0, count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        const v = A[i];
        if (seen[v] >= head) head = seen[v] + 1;
        seen[v] = i;
        count += i - head + 1;
        if (count >= 1e9) return 1e9;
    }

    return count;
}
