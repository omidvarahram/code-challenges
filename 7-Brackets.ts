/**A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if any of the following conditions is true:

S is empty;
S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.

Write a function:

function solution(S: string): number;

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
string S is made only of the following characters: '(', '{', '[', ']', '}' and/or ')'. */

function solution(S: string): number {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    const matching: Record<string, string> = {
        ')': '(',
        ']': '[',
        '}': '{'
    };

    for (const char of S) {
        if (char === '(' || char === '[' || char === '{') {
            stack.push(char);
        } else {
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== matching[char]) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }

    return stack.length === 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
