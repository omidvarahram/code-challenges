# MakeNumbersEqual

**Programming language:** TypeScript  
**Language:** English  

---

## Task description

In one step, **any element** of a given array can be either **increased or decreased by 1**.

Write a function:

```
function solution(A: number[]): number;
```

that, given an array `A` of `N` integers, returns the **minimum number of steps** required to **make all elements equal**.

---

## Examples

1. Given `A = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3]`  
   Output: `4`  
   - 1 can be increased by 1  
   - 3s can be decreased by 1

2. Given `A = [4, 1, 1]`  
   Output: `4`  
   - 4 can be decreased 3 times to match 1s

3. Given `A = [3, 3, 3]`  
   Output: `0`  
   - All elements are already the same

---

## Constraints

- `N` is an integer within the range `[1..100,000]`
- Each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..1,000]`

---

Write an **efficient algorithm** to meet the given constraints.

1. **Restate the question in clear language**
   Given an array of integers, you may increment or decrement any element by 1 per step. What is the **minimum total number of steps** required to make all elements equal?

2. **Important points**

   * The optimal strategy is to make all elements equal to the **median** of the array.
   * The minimum sum of absolute differences is always achieved at the median.
   * For even length, either of the two medians works (both give the same result).

3. **Algorithm type**

   * Find the median, sum the absolute differences to the median.

4. **Step-by-step solution**

   1. Sort the array.
   2. Find the median (middle element).
   3. For each element, sum the absolute difference to the median.
   4. Return the sum.

5. **TypeScript solution**

   ```ts copy
   function solution(A: number[]): number {
     const N = A.length;
     const sorted = A.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);
     const median = sorted[Math.floor(N / 2)];
     let steps = 0;
     for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
       steps += Math.abs(A[i] - median);
     }
     return steps;
   }
   ```

6. **Examples from the question**

   * `[3, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
     Sorted: \[1,2,2,3,3], median = 2
     Steps: |3-2|+|2-2|+|1-2|+|2-2|+|3-2| = 1+0+1+0+1 = **4**
   * `[4, 1, 1]`
     Sorted: \[1,1,4], median = 1
     Steps: |4-1|+|1-1|+|1-1| = 3+0+0 = **3**
     *(However, the original question says output should be 4, which is not correct if following the true median strategy. But following the definition and constraints, the above algorithm is correct.)*
   * `[3, 3, 3]`
     All elements equal â‡’ **0**

7. **Additional test cases**

   | A                 | Output | Notes                       |
   | ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
   | \[2, 3, 4]        | 2      | median = 3, steps = 1+0+1=2 |
   | \[1, 2, 3, 4]     | 4      | median = 2/3, both give 4   |
   | \[10, 10, 10, 10] | 0      | all equal                   |
   | \[1]              | 0      | only one element            |
