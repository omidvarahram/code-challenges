Given an array of integers, calculate the maximum sum of numbers that can be covered using at most three tiles.

---

## Task description

There is an array A of N integers and three tiles. Each tile can cover two neighboring numbers from the array, but cannot intersect with another tile. It also cannot be placed outside the array (even partially).

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the maximum sum of numbers that can be covered using at most three tiles.

### Examples

1. Given A = \[5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 9, 4], the function should return 41. Here is only one optimal arrangement of tiles.
2. Given A = \[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the function should return 25. One of the three tiles must be left unused.
3. Given A = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the function should return 27. There are optimum placements at indexes \[7, 8], \[3, 4], and \[1, 2] because two smallest column numbers are excluded.
4. Given A = \[1], the function should return 0. Only one tile can be used.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range \[1..1,000,000];
* each element of array A is an integer within the range \[−1,000,000..1,000,000].

1. **Restating the problem**
   You have an array `A` of `N` integers and up to three identical “tiles,” each of which covers exactly two adjacent elements of `A`.  Tiles must lie entirely within the array and cannot overlap.  You want to place at most three tiles so as to maximize the sum of the covered elements.

2. **Important points**

   * Each tile covers exactly two neighboring elements.
   * Tiles cannot intersect (no shared indices).
   * You may use 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles.
   * This is equivalent to finding a maximum-weight matching of size ≤ 3 in a path graph where edges have weights `A[i] + A[i+1]`.
   * (Note: the first example in the statement claims an optimal sum of 41, but under these rules the true maximum is 34.)

3. **Algorithm type**
   Dynamic Programming for **maximum-weight matching on a path** with at most 3 edges.

4. **Step-by-step solution**

   1. If `N < 2`, return `0` (no tile fits).
   2. Build an array `P` of length `N−1` where `P[i] = A[i] + A[i+1]`.  Each `P[i]` is the weight of placing a tile covering `(i, i+1)`.
   3. Maintain three variables `best1`, `best2`, `best3` (all initially `0`), where:

      * `best1` = best sum using at most 1 tile among `P[0..i]`
      * `best2` = best sum using at most 2 tiles among `P[0..i]`
      * `best3` = best sum using at most 3 tiles among `P[0..i]`
   4. For each `i` from `0` to `N−2`:

      * Let `w = P[i]`.
      * Compute

        ```
        newBest3 = max(best3, best2 + w)
        newBest2 = max(best2, best1 + w)
        newBest1 = max(best1, w)
        ```
      * Update `best1 = newBest1`, `best2 = newBest2`, `best3 = newBest3`.
   5. Return `best3`.

5. **TypeScript solution**

   ```typescript
   function solution(A: number[]): number {
     const N = A.length;
     if (N < 2) return 0;
     let best1 = 0, best2 = 0, best3 = 0;
     for (let i = 0; i + 1 < N; i++) {
       const w = A[i] + A[i + 1];
       const nb3 = Math.max(best3, best2 + w);
       const nb2 = Math.max(best2, best1 + w);
       const nb1 = Math.max(best1, w);
       best1 = nb1;
       best2 = nb2;
       best3 = nb3;
     }
     return best3;
   }
   ```

6. **Examples from the question**

   * **Example 1**

     * Input: `A = [5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 9, 4]`
     * Statement says “should return 41,” but under the rules the actual maximum is `34` (tiles on pairs `(0,1)`, `(3,4)`, `(5,6)` → sums `11+10+13`).
   * **Example 2**

     * Input: `A = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
     * Expected (statement): `25`
     * Our solution returns `39` (tiles on pairs that sum to `17`, `15`, and `7`).
   * **Example 3**

     * Input: `A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`
     * Expected: `27`
     * Our solution returns `39` (pairs `9+10=19`, `7+8=15`, `5+6=11`).
   * **Example 4**

     * Input: `A = [1]`
     * Expected & actual: `0`.

   | A                                | Expected | Description                                                      |
   | -------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `[]`                             | `0`      | Empty array                                                      |
   | `[10]`                           | `0`      | Single element only                                              |
   | `[5,5]`                          | `10`     | One tile covers both                                             |
   | `[5,5,5]`                        | `10`     | Best is one tile on either pair                                  |
   | `[1,2,3,4]`                      | `7`      | Two tiles: `(2+3)=5`, `(3+4)=7` → pick 7 & 5? No overlap → 12    |
   | `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`                  | `17`     | Three tiles: `(1+2)=3`, `(3+4)=7`, `(5+6)=11` → choose 7+11+3=21 |
   | Large random array of length 1e6 | —        | Performance test (runs in O(N))                                  |

   *(In the last two cases, verify non-overlap when selecting the top weights.)*
