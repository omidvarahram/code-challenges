# EraseOneLetter

**Easy**  
**20 min**

Remove one letter from a word so that the resulting string will be as small as possible (alphabetically).

---

## Task description

Write a function `solution` that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the alphabetically smallest string that can be obtained by removing exactly one letter from S.

---

### Examples:

1. Given S = "acb", by removing one letter, you can obtain "ac", "ab" or "cb".  
   Your function should return **"ab"** (after removing 'c') since it is alphabetically smaller than "ac" and "bc".

2. Given S = "hot", your function should return **"ho"**, which is alphabetically smaller than "ht" and "ot".

3. Given S = "codility", your function should return **"cdility"**, which can be obtained by removing the second letter.

4. Given S = "aaaa", your function should return **"aaa"**. Any occurrence of 'a' can be removed.

---

### Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
- string S is made only of lowercase letters (aâ€“z).
